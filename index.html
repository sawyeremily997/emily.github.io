    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Emily Sawyer and I'm from Pflugerville, Texas.
        I came to Texas A&M University in Fall 2020 as a General 
        Engineering major and soon realized that engineering was 
        not my passion. I changed my major to Visualization in Summer 
        2021 and have never been happier. In addition to my B.S. in 
        Visualization, I am also pursuing minors in both Business and 
        Mathematics. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My hobbies include any and all arts/crafts, but lately I've been knitting, 
        crocheting, and graphic design. I love to go out and explore, especially antique shops.
        I like to participate in campus traditions so I go to all the home football games, 
        silver taps, bonfire memorial, and muster. Going out is fine, but I also love staying 
        in with a good book or watching a show/movie in bed.

    <h2>If you could domesticate any animal to have as a pet, what would it be?</h2>
    <p>I would domesticate either a grizzly bear. They look so soft and fluffy, great for cuddles</p>
